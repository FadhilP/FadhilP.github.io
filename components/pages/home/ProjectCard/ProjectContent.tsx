        EstimatePRO is an application that my team and I made for the company
        PT. Reefconindo Cemerlang Inti. I led a team of 9 people to work on a
        website for the company which served as a database for the company to
        work on. Our team is tasked to kick start the project and implement the
        core features needed. The team and I use the python Django framework to
        make the website because of the company hardware limitations. I
        personally oversee and direct my teams work from the requirements
        provided by the client. The project lasted up to about 4 months in
        total, starting from designing to finishing the core product.
